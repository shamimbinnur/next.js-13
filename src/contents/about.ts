      description: "The core feature of Next.js 13 is its enhanced Server Side Rendering capabilities. Next.js 13 is designed to maximize server-side rendering of components, resulting in a significant improvement in website performance. Next.js 13 introduces a new 'App Router' structure in addition to the previous 'Page' directory structure. Every component in the 'App' directory is rendered as a server-side component, which means the developer has to explicitly specify client-side rendering."
